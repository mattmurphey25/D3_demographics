          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>When looking at poverty, we see positive correlation with all of the three of the y-axis variables. The first 
            variable, obesity percentage, shows the poverty percentage is generally higher in states with higher obesity. The 
            second variable, smoking percentage, mirrors the results seen in obesity quite well. There also appear to be less
            outliars. The last variable, the uninsured healthcare percentage, has a similar look to the previous two variables, 
            but it has more outliars. These results go a long way in showing us that there's reasonable data to show us that poverty 
            is a gateway for obesity, smoking, and no healthcare. Therefore, it also says that those three y-axis variables are connected.</p>

          <p>When looking at age, th correlations stop. All three y-axis variables do not correlate at all with age. As seen with poverty, all 
            of the y-axis variables are connected, and therefore age doesn't tell much about any of the three.
          </p>

          <p>The last x-axis varable, medium household income, gives similar results to poverty, but the correlation is negative instead, since 
            higher x-values are wealthier states. Obesity and smoaking percentages are well correlated, while healthcare has outliars.</p>
